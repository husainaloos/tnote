# Idea

Here is the idea:

This should be able to manage note files located in `Documents/notes`. That's all.

The functionality that I want to support is 

- `tnote --create my_personal_notes` which creates a `my_personal_notes.md` files
- `tnote my_personal_notes` which opens `my_personal_notes.md` file using `$EDITOR`
- `tnote --remove my_personal_notes` which removes the file `my_personal_notes.md`
- `tnote --list` which lists all the ntoes available
